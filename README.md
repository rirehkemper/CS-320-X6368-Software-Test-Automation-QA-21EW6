Software test automation course with Southern New Hampshire University

The following questions and reflections prompted per the course, however insight into my personal knowledge and feelings will be reflected within the answers provided.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  It starts with proper planning and a deep understanding of the requirements. While producing the codes, constant reflection of adherence to safety and code functionality should be addressed. Code safety should be written within the code from the very start and safety testing should be extensively performed at the end, as well as white box testing of functional and non-functional matters. Black box testing can also be performed to give a non-biased test and to ensure that there is cohesion in the written code prior to implementation testing and release.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I cannot stress enough the importance of communication to adequately make concrete the ideas and requirements that are brought up. Communicating the interpretation and understanding of the requirements can guarantee that the correct focus will be maintained. 

How do I approach designing software?
Considerations of the software functions and the objects that are going to be needed to fulfill those functions and the user requirements are the bloodline of a good program. While considering these topics, a proper design can be implemented into flowcharts and other preplanning agendas. Having a concrete approach will keep the team and individual programmers on topic and will result in a better end product.
